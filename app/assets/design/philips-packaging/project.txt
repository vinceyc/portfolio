Philips Lightbulb Packaging

The package structure protects the lightbulbs during transport and folds open to double as a storage shelf for the product. The dieline requires a single sheet of material that can be assembled without glue. Clean point-of-purchase information and striking graphics are used to appeal to the practical and busy consumer.
